These can help you to improve staff performance and increase guest retention, or even predict popular dishes and identify VIP customers. Having a specialized POS for bars makes it easy for customers to calculate a tip. Inventory control in a POS system helps you identify all patterns for ingredient usage over a selected time frame.

Remember that, like most other business solutions, a POS system should be able to reliably and efficiently address your retail business requirements. Apart from order management, restaurant table management, payment handling, inventory management, employee management, and menu management, it comes with CRM capabilities- all of which we've repeatedly tried, tested and confirmed that they indeed perform well.</p>

Reporting: Most POS systems will also come with some form of base reporting If you're a smaller business or one that doesn't plan to rely on analytics much, you may be perfectly happy with a system with just a handful of basic reports. With inventory management, you can change menu details, like name, quantity, and price, in real-time.</p>
<p>The first one is the mobile payment system that, thanks to the use of WiFi tablets and mobile POS, allows an exclusive payment via mobile and card only, potentially everywhere in the store, reducing the time spent in a queue.
