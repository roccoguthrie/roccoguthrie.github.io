With a POS system, your employees will be able to efficiently manage bar tabs with software that's connected between servers and bar staff, reducing confusion and miscommunication between servers, the bar, and kitchen. A large library of integrations helps this iPad POS stand out as one of the more flexible restaurant services.

<p>We culled seven of the best POS systems depending on a restaurant's particular needs. Our POS software enables restaurateurs to improve the profitability of their business through faster and more accurate order processing, multiple integrated modules like customer interface, employee interface, and access to 100+ reports. Another benefit of cash: there are no associated credit card fees.

After going through several bar POS systems reviews, we found users love TouchBistro because it is fast and easily customizable.</p>

Besides register capabilities, Revel has a ton of additional features, such as ingredient-level inventory management, analytics and QuickBooks integration.
