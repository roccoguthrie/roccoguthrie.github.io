<p>For restaurants, POS software is seen to continue to harness the power of the cloud as doing so makes them accessible anytime, anywhere.

The small businesses hold the basic features of the POS system, so their prices are more affordable rather than the large organizations that believe in investing in the plans that offer more advanced features.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>

Square provides feedback through intelligent reports and analytics, giving you insights on your operations and a real-time situation on your sales, customers, and more.
