One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>Upserve is an all-in-one restaurant management solution that combines payment processing, point of sale, inventory management, and reservation systems. Now how the software works is that every time an item is scanned it will be deducted from the inventory database. Keep track of your customers habits and send them special offers and sale notices. Modern POS systems are commonly programmable or allow enhancement with third-party software programs.</p>
<p>Such terminals are supported with various hardware components; cash registers, age verifiers, kitchen printers, barcode scanners, kitchen buzzers, and more. Springboard is a powerful, cloud-based POS software and management system for retailers.

<p>Again, these exploits by hackers could only be made possible because payment cards were processed through the POS system allowing the malware to either intercept card data during processing or steal and transmit unencrypted card data that is stored in the system database. A POS should have customer relationship management (CRM) to track all customer data. Vend POS checks most of the boxes small businesses are looking for when it comes to a point-of-sale solution.</p>
<p>Many times it will have the MSR built in. Many large stores use mechanical keyboards which are rated for higher use than a standard consumer keyboard.
