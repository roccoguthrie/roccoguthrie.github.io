Self-service kiosks - A large self-service kiosk can help customers serve themselves, saving your staff time. An online restaurant management system is essentially a web application that is developed to automate the daily activities of a restaurant. On top of payment processing fees, many point of sale systems will charge your business for using their software. The POS serves as the central component for your business ; it's the hub where everything—like sales, inventory and customer management—merges.</p>

Tableside service helps restaurants reduce or fully eliminate the constant travel by servers between tables and a terminal.

<p>It has numerous SEO and marketing platform integrations so you can easily market your business and attract new customers.

<p>Business Intelligence tools are used to retrieve this huge amount of data from different systems and give the end user an opportunity for analysis. The primary reason you need a point of sale for a restaurant is to accept cash and credit card payments. Multiple configurations as per the store requirement - I will explain with a simple example, say a retail chain wants to run a promotional offer only in one particular city, in such case, special configurations are required to be done for POS systems running in that city.</p>
