<p>The "point of sale" in any retail store, restaurant, grocery store, and so on refers to the location where transactions typically occur (i.e. check-out). But just because you have someone on the phone doesn't mean your system is back online; you're still losing revenue every time an impatient customer walks out of the store. All function essentially as sales and cash management tools, but each has features that are unique. In essence, they are built to help you with inventory management, order management, customer management, table management, credit card processing, menu management, employee management, and remote real-time tracking of all the KPIs plus cash flow.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it's often more expensive and the hardware is probably going to be unusable if you switch POS software. If you plan to stick with the payment-processing service you are currently using, you should look at POS systems that will work with that system (known as integrated processing” because the outside company's payments are incorporated into a POS). With a flat and predictable monthly service fee, it's beneficial for merchants who want the lowest TCO (total cost of ownership) of any other full-featured touchscreen point-of-sale systems in the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>Interested businesses can get a quote from the Revel sales team for a customized POS solution. These apps allow customers to provide payment information by holding their mobile device to a near-field communication (NFC) reader NFC readers are becoming an increasingly common feature on credit card readers, but will typically cost extra. Bindo is a POS system for the iPad which helps retailers and restaurateurs manage their business easier with a cloud-based POS.</p>

<p>Advanced features of KORONA's automation and retail inventory management helps you identify and resolve problems to improve business operations. 1.

It incorporates barcode, scanning, credit card swipes, inventory scanning and so on. It also helps in handling accounts payable, accounts receivables, customer information, and supplier information etc.</p>
<p>The solution offers a set of table management features that facilitates coordination between the kitchen and the restaurant floor. One thing to watch out for is that sometimes these features are included in the basic monthly software fee while other times they need to be purchased, upping the price. From cash, credit card, check, debit, on account, Apple Pay, and Google Wallet, accept virtually all forms of payment.</p>

Simplify your accounting process, build demand conscious rosters, generate online orders, and drive sales through loyalty programs with hospitality's most integrated point of sale.

<p>At the heart of Bluestore Live is an admin console, in which a business's data is securely stored on BlueStore's servers living in the cloud or the company's own private URL.
