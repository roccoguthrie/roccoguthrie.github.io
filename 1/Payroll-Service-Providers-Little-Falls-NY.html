IVend Retail presents a series of seven tightly integrated software modules that bridge your eCommerce and bricks-and-mortar presence to help you exceed your customer's great omnichannel expectations.

<p>A good POS system will log the number and value of the sales you've made, as well as tracking your inventory and letting you know when to restock.
