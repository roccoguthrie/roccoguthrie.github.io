<p>A cashier scanning bar coded merchandise at the check-out point of any retail store is a very familiar and expected occurrence. A POS System is the actual software and hardware you use to manage your business. This is ideal for restaurants where customers order at the counter, freeing up cashiers to help prepare orders faster. QuickBooks allows you to track sales, customers, and inventory quickly and easily through three versions: Basic, Pro and Multi-Store. If you go with a restaurant POS vendor that doesn't offer installation and training, it'll be on you to both install and train your staff.</p>
<p>IVend POS also helps combat in-store fraud by assigning access rights per salesperson with security, Biometric login, as well as to management of data access restrictions with password, and automatic alerts on suspicious behaviors. Most restaurant POS solutions have reporting features built-in to monitor your transactions by date, time, and type. With lack of access to processed business information, retailers earlier operated on demand forecasts based on intuitions and gut feelings.</p>
<p>A traditional retail store monitors and tracks inventory and sales as merchandise is scanned and sold at the cash register. Then this information is sent to the software in the main system, which matches information from the bar code with information in the database listing the inventory. It integrates with POS systems and streamlines taking and analyzing your beverage inventory. Essentially, though, the cost of a POS can be broken out into the expense of hardware and software, and the cost of processing payments.</p>

Any deposits you accept from your customers will be entered in QuickBooks Financial in the Unearned Revenue account. Inventory isn't a favorite topic among managers, but it's a top necessity for being ahead in a highly competitive business.</p>
<p>From taking orders in a coffee shop, booking hotel rooms, selling event tickets, retail stores, or restaurants. The best POS software for small business is Toast POS, which carries numerous features designed to handle US-based restaurants' booking, online ordering, and stocks management. POS software or POS systems are located wherever a transaction occurs, which generally tends to mean the terminal that is used for checkouts.</p>

For around $194 per month (annual subscription) and no hidden fees, you can have the powerful Cybersys POS software for any number of users and in any of your business locations.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
<p>More than a POS system, Toast POS provides a comprehensive restaurant management system that streamlines front-end and back-office processes. An effective inventory management system combined with secure storage and lock-up procedures will result in far less loss due to employee theft.
