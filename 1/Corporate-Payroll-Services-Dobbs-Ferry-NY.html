<p>If you are processing a layaway, you have to remove the merchandise from the floor yourself, because POS does not remove it from inventory until you actually sell it, and another sales associate may think you still have the item in stock.

Be sure to ask about customer service when considering a point of sale system for your small business.</p>

Acquire, retain and engage your customers, increase their average spend, manage inventory and visualize sales analytics.</p>
