<p>This feature has been around since I started in the cash register business some 25+ years ago. Integration of other aspects of the business with the bar POS system : It will entail a lot less hassle if the management of the bar and the patrons can be integrated with the other aspects of maintaining a business. Before diving into why a retail POS is not ideal for a restaurant, let's take a step back a first talk about what a point of sale is and why you should use one in the first place. With Instore, you can take orders and accept payments from anywhere in your store, manage your menu or product catalog, analyze sales data, track inventory, issue gift cards, and customize receipts with coupons and special offers.</p>
<p>We culled seven of the best POS systems depending on a restaurant's particular needs. Our POS software enables restaurateurs to improve the profitability of their business through faster and more accurate order processing, multiple integrated modules like customer interface, employee interface, and access to 100+ reports. Another benefit of cash: there are no associated credit card fees. As per the business requirement, the mPOS can be connected to external hardware like card reader, cash drawer, printer, and barcode scanner.</p>
<p>The need for special tax calculations arise when you sell an item in the restaurant where the tax is added onto the sale but the same item in the bar has the tax included. With Zomato Book, you get benefits and features commonly found in the higher prices POS systems. But, taking the time to do your homework on point of sale systems can really pay off. Pre-authorization feature works great for bar tabs and lets customers hold onto their credit cards while they party.</p>

<p>POS systems come with a wide variety of features and add-ons. One thing you should note though- while you comfortable adopt it in a single-location business, TouchBistro's POS system is predominantly ideal for restaurant businesses with multiple locations. However, varying POS locations can give retailers more opportunities to micro-market specific product categories and influence consumers at earlier points in the sales funnel.</p>

It works on iPads and has advanced features for inventory and customer management, purchase ordering, and customizable reporting.

<p>Another significant advantage of using a restaurant management software is the ability to send orders directly to the kitchen - this is a considerable advantage by increasing food prep time, staff efficiency, and reducing errors in the kitchen. Interactive graphs help managers understand the data collected in the software system's reporting and analytics features. A modern POS system will consist of a touchscreen computer that operates with POS software that's used to complete product orders and accept all payment types.</p>
<p>It is a must in retail stores earning revenue above $7, 00,000. If you are using a tablet-based POS system, there is one more thing that you can do to increase your customers' satisfaction. Most point of sale experts recommend choosing software and basing the decision on what hardware to use off of the software system, rather than vice versa. The Epicor Eagle N Series is Epicor's present comprehensive retail software system built around features such as multichannel sales, a point-of-sale system, and inventory and merchandising management.</p>
<p>Though they are essential to handle day to day operation in a retail store or a restaurant, they do not help generating revenue directly. Point of sales software has allowed businesses to create customer profiles that allow them to track the most popular products. The intuitive nature of LAVU's system makes it easy to learn and easy to train on, and the feature-rich iPad platform makes it easy to provide five-star customer service.</p>
