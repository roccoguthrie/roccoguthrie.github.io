<p>The core of hospitality or retail business, for that matter any trade, is the cash register. After all, with customers increasingly expecting the latest and greatest tech, you don't want to be known as the bar that delivers a poor experience with dated equipment.

<p>POS systems allow someone in the business to phone up transactions, make payments into the system as well as managing inventory handling and the printing of reports. Good POS software enables you to boost your ability to attract more customers and track and make sales depending on your needs.
