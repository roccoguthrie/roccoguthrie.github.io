<p>A cashier scanning bar coded merchandise at the check-out point of any retail store is a very familiar and expected occurrence. A POS System is the actual software and hardware you use to manage your business. This is ideal for restaurants where customers order at the counter, freeing up cashiers to help prepare orders faster. QuickBooks allows you to track sales, customers, and inventory quickly and easily through three versions: Basic, Pro and Multi-Store. If you go with a restaurant POS vendor that doesn't offer installation and training, it'll be on you to both install and train your staff.</p>
<p>You may be able to use all or most of your existing hardware when you add Lightspeed to your business—speak to your sales rep for more information. Brigade POS was developed by a team of experienced restauranteurs and software innovators who wanted to address the 3 core problems inherent with almost every POS system: 1. Reliability. Every business is unique, and TallySales Retail Management Systems allows you to run your business your way.</p>
<p>One of the biggest advantages provided by the modern day POS systems is the help they can offer you by tracking your inventory levels. Most payment processors will send you the credit card reader for free. Although a POS system is an essential tool for any retail store, it shouldn't be the only one you have in your arsenal. Whether you're a sommelier or a barback , learning everything you can about restaurant and bar technology will ensure you end up with tools and solutions that fit perfectly with work style, business model, or management style.</p>

With open API's, these POS systems can allow integration platforms like DBSync to share the data with various other apps securely, thus avoiding double data entry. Just as there are many different types of restaurants, so there are many different types of POS systems, and like any tool it is important to choose the right one for the job.</p>

<p>When you open a restaurant, cafe or bar, you need a point-of-sale system to accept credit and debit payments.

The vital purpose of any such system is to keep the business data organized, well-managed and maximize profit and the POS knowledge will help your staff to work efficiently and enhanced productivity.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
