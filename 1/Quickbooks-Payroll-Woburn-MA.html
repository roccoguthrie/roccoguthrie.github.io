<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. These can help you to improve staff performance and increase guest retention, or even predict popular dishes and identify VIP customers. Having a specialized POS for bars makes it easy for customers to calculate a tip. Inventory control in a POS system helps you identify all patterns for ingredient usage over a selected time frame. So, whether you're replacing your current POS system or buying a new one altogether, here's what you should consider as well as a bit of inspiration from fellow small businesses.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it's often more expensive and the hardware is probably going to be unusable if you switch POS software. If you plan to stick with the payment-processing service you are currently using, you should look at POS systems that will work with that system (known as integrated processing‚Äù because the outside company's payments are incorporated into a POS). With a flat and predictable monthly service fee, it's beneficial for merchants who want the lowest TCO (total cost of ownership) of any other full-featured touchscreen point-of-sale systems in the hospitality industry.</p>
