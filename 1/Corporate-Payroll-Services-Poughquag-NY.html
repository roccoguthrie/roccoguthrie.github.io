<p>Easy Retail for You (er4u) Small Business POS Software can be used on a number of devices or hardwares. The QuickBooks POS is essentially a separate business software that can be used in support of the overall QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions package. Whether it's something as small as a smartphone plugin, or something as large as an entire countertop register, the hardware for your point of sale system will likely cost your business a one-off lump sum. Adapt to your customers' needs with convertible point of sale systems.</p>
<p>As well, POS software can be integrated into other applications so that all areas of business management can be viewed in one central place. Point of Sale System helps the retailers to manage their physical stores with ease. A major consideration is that of electronic payment clearance, so that the shop can take credit cards and debit cards along with cash. Information on the workload per hour allows for efficient management of your staff.</p>
<p>Also, manage multiple locations, and offers multi-user staff logins for security, time and tip tracking. Some restaurant POS systems offer these features as an integrated part of their system, but many do not. Transform data into decisions with integrated reporting and analytics for real-time insight into KPIs, including best sellers, customer analysis and sales performance. As consumers, we see barcodes used all the time: purchasing from any retail store, renting a car, attending major events, flying, and even going to the doctor.</p>

<p>In short the software makes running the retail store easily and conveniently. Smaller restaurants or food trucks can trim down options to the basics for what small food service needs. We focused our products on two vertical markets; Computer Service & Retail Point of Sales and Restaurant Point of Sales. Some systems offer functionality which is close to that offered by CMS packages; for example, sending emails to customers to thank them for sales, advertise bargains or offer coupons, and offer other loyalty perks.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of companies that exist only to provide their bar and restaurant software to you. TouchBistro restaurant POS system doesn't come with purchase-ordering and vendor management capabilities. This simplifies the payment process for both customers and establishments. Another fast-growing standard is the near-field communications (NFC) transaction, which is an electronic payment system being popularized by mobile giants such as Apple Pay and Google Wallet ( at Google Pay) Making sure your POS system candidate can handle these new emerging systems is only half of the equation.</p>
