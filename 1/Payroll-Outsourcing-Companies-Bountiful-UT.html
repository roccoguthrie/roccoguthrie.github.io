<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>Below we have compiled some of the most popular types of POS systems and what features and tools they usually come with to help you figure out what will most benefit your business. The POS is made up of software along with hardware. Software - The user should study the options capabilities and costs to ensure that the point of sale app is the right fit for their business needs. Some POS systems will even accept Apple Pay or Amazon Pay, which are contactless” payment types.</p>
<p>Keeping a count all the inventory and in-hand stock across physical stores is complex. The earliest POS systems were nothing more than written receipts, but retailers now prefer electronic POS solutions These streamline the sales process, as well as allowing the merchant to collect valuable sales data. Meanwhile, users can opt for the Station + Mini to provide a POS solution on each side of the counter - for the customer and the salesperson.</p>
<h2>Information Technology And The Global Village Bountiful</h2>
<p>With Shopify POS, you can manage all of your in-store and online selling in one place. Traditionally, POS systems were physical cash registers that accepted only cash, checks, and credit cards. From its start as part of an initial purchase order, to its receipt in the store or warehouse, as it is transferred between locations, when it is counted and re-counted - and eventually as part of a sale from the POS.</p>
<p>A POS system also frees your staff from many time consuming tasks, allowing them to concentrate on the most important job at hand - customer service. A POS system is computer software and hardware networked together to track sales and inventory as they occur. The user can experience better processing capability, enhanced communication, sophisticated consumer analytics, real-time inventory management, and wireless connectivity with mPOS smart devices.</p>

<p>You may, for example, not need a cash drawer if the majority of sales are through card. Mobile POS systems allow employees to mingle with your customers on the store floor, deterring shoplifting. For example, you could ask customers questions such as "do you ever shop with us online?" or "would you be interested in a frequent shopper program?" Also, keep in mind that even if there are software packages designed specifically for your type of business, they may vary wildly and you still need to research the features to determine what'll work best for your business.</p>

Customers can pay with multiple tender types and can accept two or more payment types in a single transaction.</p>
<p>But restaurant POS systems these days do much more than accept payments: They track inventory; text and email receipts; analyze customer and sales data; do invoicing; and help manage employees, among other capabilities. The POS includes a payment system, online ordering platforms, accounting systems an CRM. All of this data can help businesses to maximize profits and eliminate waste.

It appears from such software reviews that enterprise-level cloud-based POS systems are currently lacking in the market.
