<p>A cashier scanning bar coded merchandise at the check-out point of any retail store is a very familiar and expected occurrence. A POS System is the actual software and hardware you use to manage your business. This is ideal for restaurants where customers order at the counter, freeing up cashiers to help prepare orders faster. QuickBooks allows you to track sales, customers, and inventory quickly and easily through three versions: Basic, Pro and Multi-Store. If you go with a restaurant POS vendor that doesn't offer installation and training, it'll be on you to both install and train your staff.</p>
<p>POS systems still include both software and hardware components, but they now also offer many new functions as well. As the data are instantly available and input into your retail POS accounting back office software, you can now spot trends as they happen, not after they are long gone. Each day restaurants handle large volumes of cash and credit card transactions, making a POS system necessary. In this article, let's take a look at the ten best restaurant management software that are currently quite popular in the market.</p>
<p>Cloud-based POS systems allow you to access your sales from anywhere through any mobile devices.

<p>Here, it's essential to know that when your customers use a restaurant reservation system to book tables, you will be able to host them better.

<p>Hardware — Many POS systems come with hardware such as cash drawers, tablets, card readers, and ticket printers.

Retailers with a lot of inventory need a barcode scanner to help them manage, stock, and speed up their checkout process. POS hold all the tracks for customers and their respective orders with an eye on business loyalty programs, which in return results in better shopper experience.</p>
<p>An optimized POS system will help your bar or nightclub — streamlining operations, better understanding customers, and allowing staff to provide the best possible service to all of your guests.

The cost of a point of sale system will depend on the features you want included in the package, as well as its ability to make online connections with the main central computer.</p>
<p>If you are operating a business, chances are good that you will need a point-of-sale (POS) system to complete consumer purchase transactions - and bars are no exception. Your software handles much more than the sale aspect of the transaction - retail management software is a more accurate description. POS packages frequently come with integrated accounting modules, including general ledger, accounts receivable, accounts payable, purchasing, and inventory control systems.</p>

<p>Hardware — Many POS systems come with hardware such as cash drawers, tablets, card readers, and ticket printers.

<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
<p>Customer data is highly useful for advertising as this data can provide insights on which customer would be interested in your sale. Specifically designed by restaurant people, Upserve merges an easy to use interface with powerful POS features to modernize and streamline your restaurant operations. By eliminating double-entry bookkeeping and integrating credit-card transaction with a Retail Management System, data entry mistakes and correction re-entry is greatly reduced.</p>

<p>From stock and inventory management to detailed reporting and Customer Relationship Management, the new-age cloud restaurant POS provides complete automation of the restaurant operations. Unlike other POS systems, you're not locked into using one specific payment provider That way you're free to use whoever's offering the best rate. This is present in both online purchases as well as transactions carried out in traditional brick and mortar stores.</p>
<p>Again, these exploits by hackers could only be made possible because payment cards were processed through the POS system allowing the malware to either intercept card data during processing or steal and transmit unencrypted card data that is stored in the system database. A POS should have customer relationship management (CRM) to track all customer data. Vend POS checks most of the boxes small businesses are looking for when it comes to a point-of-sale solution.</p>
