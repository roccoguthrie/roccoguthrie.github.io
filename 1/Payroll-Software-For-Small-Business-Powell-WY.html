<p>Store owners, especially in these hard times, have to watch their pennies when investing in Point of Sale (POS) hardware. Considering all that, it's not hard to see why pos terminals can be found in restaurants, hotels, bars, shops, stores, malls. With customer relationship management, maintain customer loyalty programs, issue gift cards, maintain customer data and add comments and notes. TouchBistro is one of the few restaurant POS systems that have not only perfected the basic POS functionalities, but also gone beyond them to offer exclusive, out-of-the-box extras.</p>
<p>Talech is perfect for restaurants and bars. Salespeople sometimes use it when they track inventory. When you log into the app, you'll notice that the overall interface is simple, intuitive and it provides smart but straightforward tools for managing customer information, generating sales reports, tracking inventory, optimizing staffing, as well as driving customer loyalty. It is easy to install and so simple to deploy that I'm embarrassed to brag about it. Truths when I say the features developed into the application are cutting edge and developed with the latest software methodologies.</p>
<p>Designed for food service businesses and restaurants, this cloud-based restaurant and catering management solution manages inventories and recipes. We use livepos and this helps in simplifying our sales report every day and its accurate compared to the old fashioned cash registers.

<p>POS systems come with a wide variety of features and add-ons. One thing you should note though- while you comfortable adopt it in a single-location business, TouchBistro's POS system is predominantly ideal for restaurant businesses with multiple locations. However, varying POS locations can give retailers more opportunities to micro-market specific product categories and influence consumers at earlier points in the sales funnel.</p>
<p>Based in Lebanon, BIM POS offers POS software and hardware solutions to retail and restaurant businesses in more than 16 countries. Professional Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram pages keep the owner engaged with all customers at all times.
