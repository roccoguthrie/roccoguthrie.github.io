<p>The "point of sale" in any retail store, restaurant, grocery store, and so on refers to the location where transactions typically occur (i.e. check-out). But just because you have someone on the phone doesn't mean your system is back online; you're still losing revenue every time an impatient customer walks out of the store. All function essentially as sales and cash management tools, but each has features that are unique. In essence, they are built to help you with inventory management, order management, customer management, table management, credit card processing, menu management, employee management, and remote real-time tracking of all the KPIs plus cash flow.</p>
<p>Many systems also feature add-on modules such as payroll time clocks and customer preference databases. Easier payment options : When payments of the checks are as easy as swiping or tapping a card, not only do the staffs not have to worry about keeping tab over the patrons upon serving the checks but also ensure that the patrons enjoy a hassle-free check-out after a night's merriment. The best restaurant POS systems are also cost-effective, well reviewed, easy to use, and come with a professional customer support team.</p>

Hence it is important to keep a credit card terminal in any retail store or restaurant.

<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
