The cloud-based POS solution helps manage your stuff, serve customers accurately and in time, and monitor performance to depict trends and opportunities. With the diverse needs of different food establishments, no POS software is a fit-all solution. ShopKeep doesn't offer as many advanced features as Toast or Revel, but its raw ingredient tracking software and advanced employee permissions still places this POS system ahead of many of its competitors in these areas.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it's often more expensive and the hardware is probably going to be unusable if you switch POS software. If you plan to stick with the payment-processing service you are currently using, you should look at POS systems that will work with that system (known as integrated processing” because the outside company's payments are incorporated into a POS). With a flat and predictable monthly service fee, it's beneficial for merchants who want the lowest TCO (total cost of ownership) of any other full-featured touchscreen point-of-sale systems in the hospitality industry.</p>

<p>Make sure to see how the management and reporting features actually work before you pay any money. Food and drink sectors like restaurants require a different set of features in the POS software than retailers. Keep a track of inventory and enjoy smooth sales operation.

Mobility is one of the most popular trends in today's point-of-sale systems because it refers to the ability to move the functionality of a POS software out from the cash register and into the hands of the employees for quicker, more customer-oriented business transactions. Keeping your business and customer data safe should be at the top of your list when you're on the hunt for a system.</p>
<p>EMV payments are processed by dipping a credit card into a slot in the card reader and allowing it to read the microchip. One of the biggest advantages of a mobile POS is that it can support your business's growth from one store to many.
