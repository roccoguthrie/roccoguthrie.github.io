<p>With an online POS, you can use your own hardware. Let's now look at the things to consider before buying any restaurant management software for your business. If your business relies heavily on return business, then opting for a point of sale that offers this feature could seriously up your customer return rate.

Square POS also sells Square Stand, an iPad contactless and chip stand that allows contactless payments as well as chip cards, NFC and magstripe.
