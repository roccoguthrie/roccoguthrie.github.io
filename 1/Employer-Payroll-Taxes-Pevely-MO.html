<p>Grow your food & drink business with Storezigo Restaurant POS Software. They have Gift shop and homewares business customers who are happy. As IoT blurs the line between online and offline, it will become easy for retailers to stock products based on purchase trends. POS System must have to be fully automated, that is if you're making any change in stock offline and then must have to be reflected on online store website or web-store. Get accurate and real-time data on the food and pour cost to adjust price points and recipes and keep your food and drink menu profitable.</p>
<p>IVend POS also helps combat in-store fraud by assigning access rights per salesperson with security, Biometric login, as well as to management of data access restrictions with password, and automatic alerts on suspicious behaviors. Most restaurant POS solutions have reporting features built-in to monitor your transactions by date, time, and type. With lack of access to processed business information, retailers earlier operated on demand forecasts based on intuitions and gut feelings.</p>
<p>Bottom Line: Vend POS is a highly flexible and mobile point-of-sale (POS) system that, while it lacks a few advanced features and charges extra for phone support, is an excellent choice for small businesses. Regardless if you're operating a small shop or a restaurant, you would want automation to be on your side when managing sales transactions. With a good (POS) point of sale system, you'll shape inventory to meet customer needs, and find ways to improve the bottom line.</p>
