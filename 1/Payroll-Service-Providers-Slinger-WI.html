<p>Why should you worry about the Point of Sale system you use in your business? Web-based solution that provides restaurant POS through credit card integration, automation, call center and more. You manage your inventory and order at two places and you have to keep an eye on your stock every time a sale is made. You'll also have access to the ShopKeep mobile app, where you can view real-time sales information, inventory, and data from anywhere on the go. This makes it easy for you to keep an eye on your business even when you're not physically present on location.</p>
<p>Not all retailers have the same inventory needs or offer the same services to customers. You may think of this as a mobile register that may be moved to wherever the customers are, only that it offers more capabilities than a conventional cash register. More retailers today are recognizing value in the raw data they collect from every transaction and seeing the need to use it more strategically to create a unique customer experience that will boost their bottom line and keep customers coming back for more.</p>
<p>Cashier Live works for all retail stores, but it has special features for boutiques, hardware stores and pharmacies. In other words, it is a POS system with full e-commerce functionality that lets you manage on-site and online inventory while getting a singular view of customers and being able to conduct multi-channel data analysis. It combines all basic hardware and software that is needed to serve customers and keep accurate business records.</p>

<p>POS is now commonly referred to as only the cash register feature within a retail management system. Safe, secure and fast payments: EPOS systems often come equipped with card machines, meaning payments are safe and secure. In restaurants, the ability to track ingredients in real-time and set automatic stock alerts is extremely useful, while, for retail establishments, some systems come with the ability to create your own purchase orders and track inventory across multiple locations.</p>
<p>Improved efficiency means higher customer satisfaction, lower costs and higher sales. Understand what items you should keep on your menu, how many sales come from your new promotions, how your new bartender performs, and more. But like retail sales training, don't see the purchase as a cost but as an investment. It provides recipe management and food costing, purchase management, stock management and inventory, along with a powerful reporting capability.</p>
