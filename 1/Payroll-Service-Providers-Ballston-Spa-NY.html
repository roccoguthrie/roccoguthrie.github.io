<p>Store owners, especially in these hard times, have to watch their pennies when investing in Point of Sale (POS) hardware.

<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
<p>In addition to the main menus, they can enter pre-set preparation instructions for the service bartender, or use free text if necessary. Only NCR Silver, which is one of the products covered in this POS system review, charges a one-time price for their software. In some countries, credit and debit cards are only processed via payment terminals Thus one may see quite a number of such terminals for different cards cluttering up a sale counter.</p>
