<p>All retail businesses need to use cash registers but more and more high street shops and stores are now turning away from the traditional designs and are switching to POS or, to give them their full name, Point Of Sale machines. We are offering this all-in-one restaurant system which includes the pos, printer, cash drawer, pole display and also barcode scanner together with jRestaurant POS. For merchants, unattended POS systems offer an effective strategy for managing rising labor costs, as they allow one cashier to monitor customers using multiple self-serve POS kiosks instead of ringing up orders at a single station. These systems are best suited for small businesses and entrepreneurs, small retail stores, pop-up shops, and quick-serve establishments.</p>
<p>You can even drill down into reports to see more in-depth information such as a specific employee's productivity or the sales of a particular menu item If you already own multiple businesses or plan to expand in the future, this feature will prove invaluable to you as you look to manage and understand all of your various operations and how each is contributing to your bottom line. A POS will provide the rich data and insights you need to understand your customers, improve your products, and grow your business.</p>
<p>The reporting functionality allows managers to see their sales broken down by item sales, discounts and comps, refunds, net sales, and taxes in a searchable interface that can display revenue from the past week, past 30 days, or other set timeframe. A point of sale (POS) system is where customers make a payment for goods or services at your store. It's all about customer retention, which is up to five times less expensive than attracting new customers.</p>

<p>The point is to start with a checklist for evaluating restaurant POS systems.

Its table mapping function, for instance, provides a simple, neat and organized restaurant layout management interface.</p>

<p>Menu pricing control is vitally important to have if your bar also serves food.
