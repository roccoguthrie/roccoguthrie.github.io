<p>It may not seem so at first but pizza restaurants can be the most complex of the restaurants to manage from the software perspective. Our Acid best POS software for retail business is compatible with multi-inventory & multi- store management system. We offer a local server based point of sale system with the reliability of traditional systems and the cloud functions that every business needs. Consider what your business needs to run transactions, how your customers prefer to pay, and how much you are willing to spend. Instore is an all-in-one iPad POS system for restaurants, cafes, bakeries, delis, bars and retail businesses with one or multiple locations.</p>
<p>Payment terminals, touch screens, and a variety of other POS hardware and POS software options are used to enable the transaction. From ensuring that there's enough inventory to putting together monthly sales reports, these skills are necessary in ensuring that your store runs smoothly. Although there is software designed specifically for bars, most point of sale systems used by restaurants can also be an excellent solution for bars.</p>
<p>If you are already using a payment-processing service and want to stick with it, then you will want to look at POS systems which work with that system (usually called "integrated processing" since the outside company's payments are integrated into the POS). You want your POS system to be able to handle every method you might need including debit and credit cards, checks, and cash. Other Square features allow restaurants to send invoices, manage payroll and integrate with third-party applications such as QuickBooks, Xero and TaxJar.</p>

<p>In addition, your POS system must be able to perform basic functions such as bar code scanning, payroll management, handling of cash and credit card transactions and integrate seamlessly with online shopping cart systems. This is also referred to as a credit card terminal—it's what merchants use to accept credit and debit card payments. With a mobile POS system, on the other hand, they can split the check right at the table and, if there's any confusion as to who ordered what or how the table wants to divide a shared appetizer, the waiter is right there to ask the customers.</p>
<p>Lightspeed charges 2.6% + 10¢ for payment processing (the same rate as Square for Restaurants) but can also integrate with outside payment processors, which you might prefer to use if you can secure a better rate elsewhere. After ten years, ShopKeep continues offering small, quick service restaurants an easy user interface with great base features.

The POS features include cash management, table management, and delivery management. The POS system captures the details of the reason for the return, salesperson's name, and remarks. Mobile POS systems are Cloud-based and substantially cheaper (but may be leaner in terms of extras).</p>
