<p>Purchasing a restaurant POS system on the internet can be a complex process due to the number of systems and options. Point-of-sale(POS) systems are vital to running a successful business today. In addition to fulfill the general rules of catering as great customer services and good food, the first step is to have quality management which can support your promises. Our SaaS solutions empower retailers to provide exceptional customer experiences throughout the entire shopper journey.

Our POS software enables restaurateurs to improve the profitability of their business through faster and more accurate order processing, multiple integrated modules like customer interface, employee interface, and access to 100+ reports. Another benefit of cash: there are no associated credit card fees.

<p>You may, for example, not need a cash drawer if the majority of sales are through card. Mobile POS systems allow employees to mingle with your customers on the store floor, deterring shoplifting. For example, you could ask customers questions such as "do you ever shop with us online?" or "would you be interested in a frequent shopper program?" Also, keep in mind that even if there are software packages designed specifically for your type of business, they may vary wildly and you still need to research the features to determine what'll work best for your business.</p>
<p>Manage the tables across your restaurant to monitor which tables are occupied, which are not and how many customers are seated at each table. If you are planning a very small operation, such as bagel or sandwich shop, you may not need a POS system at the opening time, especially if you aren't going to take credit cards (and there are plenty of places that still don't accept plastic). With this feature, if your business receives a reminder to refill a stock of inventory, you'll simply have to press a few buttons within your POS to do so. Keep in mind that first you'll have to onboard your vendors into your POS system.</p>
<p>While Rezku may not have as many robust features as other POS software, it still gives an impressive showing. In fact, an online presence has become so necessary that some systems, such as Shopify POS and Vend POS, include it as part of their package.

Flexible, affordable and serviceable are the key functions that aptly describe our mPOS Point of sale software system.</p>
