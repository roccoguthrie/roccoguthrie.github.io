<p>This POS system has SMS messaging, inventory management, and loyalty programs, compatible with PC, Mac, iPhone, and Windows Mobile. With the POS technology, the system's software uses the barcode on the label of the item you bought (or the key code for the particular entrée or drink, in the case of a restaurant) as an inventory regulation system as well as an efficient way to control the transaction. A lot of big box stores have wildly expensive POS solutions, some of which were custom built for their needs.</p>
