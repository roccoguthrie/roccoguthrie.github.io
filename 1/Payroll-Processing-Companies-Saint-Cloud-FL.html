Even though different types of restaurants have different needs for POS functionality, they all need reliable support and service to keep operations running.</p>
<p>A result of cloud-based servers was that retailers could start accessing their POS system by picking up any device with internet connectivity—whether it was a laptop, desktop, tablet or smartphone—and logging into their business portal.
