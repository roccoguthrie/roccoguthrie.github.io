<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. A point of sale system also can manage inventory levels across multiple business locations, allowing you to centralize your tracking system rather than relying on separate inventory schedules for each location. Tracking inventory accurately is a particularly tough challenge for restaurants and bars because the majority of your products aren't in simple units. The menus are outfitted with desirable features that allow guests to place orders, enter custom cooking specifications, order drinks, request table service, tender secure payment (from the table) and view detailed descriptions of menu items-inclusive of high-resolution images and wine and beer pairing options.</p>
<p>In order to use the bar POS software you will need hardware. With LS One you can take cash, cards, foreign currency, gift cards, credit memos and loyalty points as methods of payment.

<p>You may think of point-of-sale (PoS) systems as just ordinary cash registers, but they're evolving to do much more.

Inventory management: Many POS systems help you keep track of your product inventory, allowing you to enter specific details about each item you sell and track your product receiving, sales, and shipping.</p>
<p>In addition to the main menus, they can enter pre-set preparation instructions for the service bartender, or use free text if necessary. Only NCR Silver, which is one of the products covered in this POS system review, charges a one-time price for their software. In some countries, credit and debit cards are only processed via payment terminals Thus one may see quite a number of such terminals for different cards cluttering up a sale counter.</p>

<p>In addition, your POS system must be able to perform basic functions such as bar code scanning, payroll management, handling of cash and credit card transactions and integrate seamlessly with online shopping cart systems. This is also referred to as a credit card terminal—it's what merchants use to accept credit and debit card payments. With a mobile POS system, on the other hand, they can split the check right at the table and, if there's any confusion as to who ordered what or how the table wants to divide a shared appetizer, the waiter is right there to ask the customers.</p>
