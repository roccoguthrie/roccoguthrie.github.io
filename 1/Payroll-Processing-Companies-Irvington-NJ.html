Is a fully integrated Intuitive Restaurant POS Software suitable to work in restaurants, bars, night clubs and more. NCR Silver aims its point-of-sale solution at both small and larger businesses with hooks to enterprise-class back-ends and a wide variety of hardware options. For example, sending a sale flyer for 30% off on oversized shirts” to the customer who wears a medium sized shirt would be a waste of time.</p>
<p>Key features include table management, coursing, menu management and sales reporting. The point of sale system can be integrated with your other systems and software such as eCommerce platforms, accounting apps, ERP and warehouse systems. With traditional licensed based POS system, the only knowledge possible to obtain prior to purchase comes from words from your sales rep or doing as much research as possible to find reviews online.</p>
