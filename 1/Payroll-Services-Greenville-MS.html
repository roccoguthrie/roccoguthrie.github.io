<p>Five years ago I began searching for an easy way to track my customers, my accounts receivable, and all the other aspects of my business. Double check that the POS is able to accept chip-enabled credit and debit cards. Now whether you refer to it as a POS system or retail management system - it will do the same. And with our custom-made software, you can make sure you offer your customers the best service and gain additional customer loyalty points. While some systems can handle the POS of both restaurants and retail businesses, many systems are designed specifically to handle the demanding needs of the latter.</p>
<p>Being a restaurateur means focusing on an efficient kitchen and providing customers with great food and drinks. The software can be integrated with card terminals from PayPal, iZettle, Square, Paymentsense, Payment Express and SumUp, and works with most POS equipment. You can see POS systems in Retail Stores, Restaurants, Hospitals and almost everywhere these days where payments are involved. You can enjoy over 300 features to help run your store- they offer everything from invoicing tools to time clocks.</p>
<p>One of the biggest advantages provided by the modern day POS systems is the help they can offer you by tracking your inventory levels. Most payment processors will send you the credit card reader for free. Although a POS system is an essential tool for any retail store, it shouldn't be the only one you have in your arsenal. Whether you're a sommelier or a barback , learning everything you can about restaurant and bar technology will ensure you end up with tools and solutions that fit perfectly with work style, business model, or management style.</p>

<p>POS is now commonly referred to as only the cash register feature within a retail management system. Safe, secure and fast payments: EPOS systems often come equipped with card machines, meaning payments are safe and secure.

<p>However, several affordable, cloud-based till systems for small retailers are available today, whether it's for an off-licence, gift shop, florist, bike shop or other independent store.

Today's systems work with equal effectiveness for the cashier, the waiter (through great screen interactivity and intuitive interfaces) and the management (through better and timelier reporting).</p>
