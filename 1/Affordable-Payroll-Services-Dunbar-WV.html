<p>Run the world's best retail with Vend POS software + PayPal. The good news is you can always find a different restaurant POS solution, either as a standalone product, or bundled within a larger venue management kit with multiple attractive functionalities. The ETP Omni-channel Store provides your customers a seamless experience across all your stores, e-commerce sites and other touch points. We are hardware retailers who could not find a POS solution that completely met our needs, so we developed it ourselves.</p>
<p>This user-friendly tool is free and enables businesses to accept and process payments both in-store and even on-the-go, for both iOS or Android gadgets. Generally, if your business has annual sales of $500k or more, you can achieve considerable savings and benefits from a POS system. Depending on the POS vendor and the terms of contract, compared to traditional on-premises POS installation, the software is more likely to be continually updated by the developer with more useful features and better performance in terms of computer resources at the remote server and in terms of lesser bugs and errors.</p>
<p>Point-of-sale systems are still comprised of hardware and software components but include many new functions too. To help you minimize lost sales due to out of stocks, use replenishment capabilities in Retail Pro. You can accept payments directly by swiping and inserting the customer's cards, scanning checks, and accepting gift cards right on your POS system.
