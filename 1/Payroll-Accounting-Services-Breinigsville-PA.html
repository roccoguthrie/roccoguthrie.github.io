<p>Business Intelligence tools are used to retrieve this huge amount of data from different systems and give the end user an opportunity for analysis. The primary reason you need a point of sale for a restaurant is to accept cash and credit card payments. Multiple configurations as per the store requirement - I will explain with a simple example, say a retail chain wants to run a promotional offer only in one particular city, in such case, special configurations are required to be done for POS systems running in that city.</p>
<p>If you are operating a business, chances are good that you will need a point-of-sale (POS) system to complete consumer purchase transactions - and bars are no exception.

<p>The user purchases the POS system with hardware and accessories such as to monitor screen, cash register, barcode scanner, receipt printer, and card readers. The terms cloud and mobile point of sale systems are sometimes used interchangeably. This ability to scale the product means that businesses get to pay only for the features that they need.

<p>Many times it will have the MSR built in. Many large stores use mechanical keyboards which are rated for higher use than a standard consumer keyboard. Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. A cloud-based restaurant POS does both by providing an efficient system to modify menus and prices. Integration with 3rd Party Apps ‚Äî businesses using POS systems need to make their data available to their ERP and accounting applications.</p>
