<p>This feature has been around since I started in the cash register business some 25+ years ago. Integration of other aspects of the business with the bar POS system : It will entail a lot less hassle if the management of the bar and the patrons can be integrated with the other aspects of maintaining a business. Before diving into why a retail POS is not ideal for a restaurant, let's take a step back a first talk about what a point of sale is and why you should use one in the first place.

<p>The need for special tax calculations arise when you sell an item in the restaurant where the tax is added onto the sale but the same item in the bar has the tax included. With Zomato Book, you get benefits and features commonly found in the higher prices POS systems. But, taking the time to do your homework on point of sale systems can really pay off.
