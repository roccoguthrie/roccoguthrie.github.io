<p>The core of hospitality or retail business, for that matter any trade, is the cash register. After all, with customers increasingly expecting the latest and greatest tech, you don't want to be known as the bar that delivers a poor experience with dated equipment.

This not only means that you'll be able to serve a greater number of guests in a shorter amount of time, but also that your staff members can spend more time interacting with your guests and VIPs instead of maneuvering back and forth through the crowd to access a central payment terminal.</p>

RFID in POS can further allow for charging to a customer's card via smartphone before they leave the store.

<p>Business.a POS system that doubles as a stock and sales control system. In essence, if you have a 7% tax rate you are suffering a 7% loss on all sales at your bar. Employee Management: Many POS systems come with built-in time card functionality and the ability to manage your employees' hours. And by letting your staff take an order just as easily at a table as at a cash point, you can dramatically increase speed of service, which is important at any time of day, but especially so when customers are on a time deadline, such as at lunchtime.</p>
<p>In addition to the main menus, they can enter pre-set preparation instructions for the service bartender, or use free text if necessary. Only NCR Silver, which is one of the products covered in this POS system review, charges a one-time price for their software. In some countries, credit and debit cards are only processed via payment terminals Thus one may see quite a number of such terminals for different cards cluttering up a sale counter.</p>

Get real-time sales updates, manage transactions and track employee performance even while you are on the go. Remotely access data and be a hands-on manager even when you're away with an effective restaurant manager software.</p>
<p>Lightspeed charges 2.6% + 10¢ for payment processing (the same rate as Square for Restaurants) but can also integrate with outside payment processors, which you might prefer to use if you can secure a better rate elsewhere. After ten years, ShopKeep continues offering small, quick service restaurants an easy user interface with great base features. Retailers have the option of using local, server-based POS software, which stores sales data onsite; however, the best programs are either app- or cloud-based SaaS solutions.</p>
<p>Unlike the traditional cash register system where you cannot tell which staff member on shift rang up the sale, if you upgrade your POS equipment, you will be able to tell which staff member does what. With older POS systems, managers had a lot more workload. Much like online ordering, customers are interested in on-demand services that reduce wait times. Lightspeed makes it easy to build a customized menu, take and manage guest orders, and facilitate multiple payment methods.</p>
<p>POS Nation offers robust customer loyalty tools to empower retailers to make the most out of their loyal and returning customers. Ideally, your business's point of sale should be able to provide your customer with receipts in whatever form they prefer. It's important to consider ease of use, flexibility in pricing, what actionable insights the system provides, data security, hardware durability and quality of customer service,” says Grullon.</p>

<p>POS software will sync with the device, allowing you to take orders, check reports, manage customers, and more all with just a few taps. Today's point-of-sale (POS) systems are not just cash registers anymore thanks to new technologies like mobile devices and the cloud. While a cash register only stores money and is often attached to a computer or bar code scanner a point of sale or POS does this all in one interface.</p>
<p>If you bar code all of your merchandise than you can not only save time in checking customers out and implementing markdowns instantly, but also you can eliminate the problem of switched price tags. For example, restaurants, retail businesses, and grocery stores all have their specialties and that is why they need a POS system that meets their specific needs. With POS Software you will be able to capture complete transaction details at the point of sale, and transaction history and real-time database records are stored indefinitely so your data is always available for reporting and analysis.</p>
<p>In many ways, point of sale systems created for the restaurant industry are very similar to retail POS systems. You'll want to use POS software that integrates seamlessly with your other systems and causes limited disruption. If you're currently using Shopify to sell online, then using Shopify POS for in-store transactions is a no-brainer. Modern retail is online, in-store and mobile, so get the point of sale system that takes you where you need to go.</p>
