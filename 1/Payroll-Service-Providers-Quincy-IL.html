Datio POS is an iPad POS system for retail stores, salons, small cafes, quick-service eateries and full-service restaurants. The cash only retail business is quickly fading into obscurity. Point of sale systems were made to help business owners make day-to-day tasks easier and faster.</p>
<p>This specialty store needed a solution that is affordable, easy to use and with an integration between their Inventory and point of sale. This inconvenience is however offset by the fact that credit and debit card data is far less vulnerable to hackers, unlike when payment cards are processed through the POS system where security is contingent upon the actions taken by end-users and developers. While restaurant management software is intended to be more of an end-to-end solution, restaurant point of sale software can also contain many of the same features.</p>

This includes the ability to add and remove registers with ease, eCommerce, customer management, email marketing, integrated accounting, gift cards, and customer loyalty programs. Hopefully, this article has given you what you need to make an informed decision about the POS system you will choose for your retail business.</p>
