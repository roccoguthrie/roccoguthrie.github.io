<p>Choosing a POS, or point of sale, system seems as though it would be quite easy. For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.</p>
<p>Payment terminals, touch screens, and a variety of other POS hardware and POS software options are used to enable the transaction. From ensuring that there's enough inventory to putting together monthly sales reports, these skills are necessary in ensuring that your store runs smoothly. Although there is software designed specifically for bars, most point of sale systems used by restaurants can also be an excellent solution for bars.</p>
<p>The reporting functionality allows managers to see their sales broken down by item sales, discounts and comps, refunds, net sales, and taxes in a searchable interface that can display revenue from the past week, past 30 days, or other set timeframe.
