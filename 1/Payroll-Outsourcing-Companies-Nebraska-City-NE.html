<p>Why should you worry about the Point of Sale system you use in your business? Web-based solution that provides restaurant POS through credit card integration, automation, call center and more. You manage your inventory and order at two places and you have to keep an eye on your stock every time a sale is made. You'll also have access to the ShopKeep mobile app, where you can view real-time sales information, inventory, and data from anywhere on the go. This makes it easy for you to keep an eye on your business even when you're not physically present on location.</p>
<p>Our Point of Sale software serves as the central component for your business; it's the hub where everything - like sales, inventory and customer management merges. Life became easier for restaurant chains and multiple food outlet brands that needed to maintain consistency as well as their operations through the Central Kitchen Management feature. Customers can explore the pay-at-table options, while the restaurant becomes flexible to accept all card types with this software easily.</p>

<p>If you are processing a layaway, you have to remove the merchandise from the floor yourself, because POS does not remove it from inventory until you actually sell it, and another sales associate may think you still have the item in stock. If you need robust inventory management, reporting, integrations, and lots of customization options - consider Revel. Be sure to ask about customer service when considering a point of sale system for your small business.</p>
<p>As a storefront business, it's a big change to make when upgrading your POS, due to the time it takes to implement, training of your employees, and cash outlays for new hardware.
