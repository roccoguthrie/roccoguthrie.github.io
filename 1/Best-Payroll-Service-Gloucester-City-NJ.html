<p>The time and attendance system is another crucial aspect of managing labor. The Lavu restaurant POS system can proceed with payment processing even in offline mode. But the POS has transformed physical retail, allowing SMBs and large corporations alike to gain new, deep insights into their business. This is why I recommend taking your time and assessing the various people you will rely on to make the software work for your business. Evolving from the bulky, complex cash register system to today's highly-portable, fits-in-your-pocket card readers, accepting payments has never been simpler.</p>
<p>We culled seven of the best POS systems depending on a restaurant's particular needs. Our POS software enables restaurateurs to improve the profitability of their business through faster and more accurate order processing, multiple integrated modules like customer interface, employee interface, and access to 100+ reports. Another benefit of cash: there are no associated credit card fees. As per the business requirement, the mPOS can be connected to external hardware like card reader, cash drawer, printer, and barcode scanner.</p>
<p>The need for special tax calculations arise when you sell an item in the restaurant where the tax is added onto the sale but the same item in the bar has the tax included. With Zomato Book, you get benefits and features commonly found in the higher prices POS systems. But, taking the time to do your homework on point of sale systems can really pay off. Pre-authorization feature works great for bar tabs and lets customers hold onto their credit cards while they party.</p>

POS software companies can be found right online with just a simple search, and you will even find open source POS software, but again I suggest that you stay far away from it. They are basic and you will need to purchase feature's separately to suit your business needs, and you will find that they will actually end up costing you much more then it's worth.</p>
