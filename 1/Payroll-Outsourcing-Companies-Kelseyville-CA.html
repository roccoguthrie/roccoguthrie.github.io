<p>RETAILvantage POS Retail systems will keep your customers satisfied and provide you with powerful analysis of what is truly selling. Once you have it installed it can take a little bit of time getting your items, customers, and employees into the system. Any business records sales, but a restaurant must also be able to accept reservations and know which orders were placed from which table. Our POS software help you to keep a track on your sales with ease and aplomb. Since the system works through handheld devices connected to a main POS server, potential errors and omissions in the manual order taking process of the traditional point of sale restaurant are eliminated.</p>
<p>Runs in Offline Mode: Even when you are offline, you can punch in orders and download business reports with LimeTray restaurant software. POSGuys offers a wide range of products for retailers, restaurants and salons. The mobile POS can be used to serve customers everywhere - alternatively, there is a self-order menu that lets customers order by themselves on an iPad at their table. Yet, because the CRM database is integrated with the POS software, the information stored in the database is even more valuable.</p>
<p>The modern design allows customers to view your menu, place orders, and pay, without any wait time. Poorly implemented systems are one of the leading causes of credit card data compromises. The superior inventory management ensures on-time low-stock alerts, effective planning of the waste management and real-time information about the cost and profit per drink. The right POS and retail management software will give you the functionality you need to grow your business.</p>

Revel Systems has built-in timecards that let you track your employees' hours accurately.</p>
<p>POS Nation is a customizable POS built primarily for retailers, restaurants, and specialty stores.

<p>Improved efficiency means higher customer satisfaction, lower costs and higher sales.

Gone are those days when retailers used a cash register to process sales after which the data was transferred to accounts and stock list.</p>
<h3>Bookkeeping And Accounting Services For Small Business Kelseyville California</h3>
<p>A good POS system will log the number and value of the sales you've made, as well as tracking your inventory and letting you know when to restock. Disregarding that fact for the time being, compare a retail store with a POS System to an almost identical store with a standard electronic cash register - there are much differences than first meets the eye. Designed for small, medium, and large businesses, the system can be deployed as an online-based service, on-premise, and mobile point-of-sale solution.</p>
<p>Credit and debit card preauthorization (or "preauth") allows bartenders to swipe a customer's credit card, securely save that information as their bar tab, and verify that the card is real and has a preconfigured amount of funds on it. Therefore, buying the POS hardware is the right decision, even if you comprise a few features to cut down the initial cost. The ShopKeep Restaurant POS system generates solid insights, which come handy when you're making critical business decisions.</p>
<p>Serving bars and restaurants of all sizes, Ordyx POS is a state of the art, hybrid, point of sale system. Your business database will be hosted on secure servers that provide real-time backup. Based on my experience with the POS solution, I'd say its robust features should comfortably support basically any type of small or medium-sized business in the hospitality industry. Focus gives restaurants a competitive edge by providing simple, yet powerful restaurant management solutions.</p>

We are proud to present a system which can be adapted for all types of catering including restaurants, bars, clubs, hotels and also for outside catering.
