<p>For any restaurant, point of sale technology is important. Retailers can reasonably expect to acquire such systems (including hardware) for about $4000 US (as of 2009) per checkout lane. Sometimes, even after spending a lot of valuable time searching for the best possible system, restaurant owners end up making a mistake by basing their final decision on cost alone. Stock Visibility — keeping track of product movement can help retailers avoid stock-outs or dead stocks and thus improve customer relationships.</p>
<p>Restaurant point of sale systems cost any from the price of a daily cup of coffee to a daily surf-n-turf dinner. Having a POS system that accepts several types of payments establishes credibility with customers as soon as they walk in your store. Designed for an iPAD, this POS assists jewellers with sales processing and the management of their business.

Credit and debit card transactions are now more common than cash payments POS systems make card processing fast, easy, and secure. A quick glance at a shopper's purchase history (or all those customer details you've started collecting!) in Retail Pro can equip your sales associates with the information they need to determine what products your customer would find most interesting and relevant, and make the offer for an upsell when they're in the store.</p>
<p>This specialty store needed a solution that is affordable, easy to use and with an integration between their Inventory and point of sale. This inconvenience is however offset by the fact that credit and debit card data is far less vulnerable to hackers, unlike when payment cards are processed through the POS system where security is contingent upon the actions taken by end-users and developers. While restaurant management software is intended to be more of an end-to-end solution, restaurant point of sale software can also contain many of the same features.</p>
