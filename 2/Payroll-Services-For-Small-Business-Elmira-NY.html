<p>As consumer technology evolves and consumer behaviors change, mobile POS systems are increasingly focusing on evolving their omnichannel selling capabilities and blurring the lines between online and in-store retail. Point of sale (POS) system is the spot where your customer makes the payment for goods or services that are offered by your company. Once the inventory code is entered, the systems call up the standard or sales price, compute the price at multiple quantities and provide a running total.</p>
