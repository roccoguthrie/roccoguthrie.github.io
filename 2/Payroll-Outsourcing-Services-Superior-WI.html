<p>With the technology boom, Electronic Cash Registers (ECR) — later termed Point-of-Sale systems — have become this option, expanding beyond the transaction register to cloud-based POS applications that allow complete control over multiple global retail lines. With Mink Foodiee in-depth reporting and analytics, view real-time reports from anywhere, anytime, and make quick data-driven decisions for your restaurant. We provide custom configured systems with computer hardware and software, all ready to plug and play. POS systems have been touted as valuable tools for a wide variety of business purposes, including refining target marketing strategies; tracking supplier purchases; determining customer purchasing patterns; analyzing sales (on a daily, monthly, or annual basis) of each inventory item, department, or supplier; and creating reports for use in making purchases, reorders, etc.</p>

Add to that robust multi-location management tools and an amazing array of ready integrations, and you tailor Lightspeed to fit your exact bar service needs.
