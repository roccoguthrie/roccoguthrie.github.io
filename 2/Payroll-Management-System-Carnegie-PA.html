<p>POS or Point of Sale refers to the system that records financial transactions in stores and restaurants. Comprehensive inventory management. Easily run promos by putting some items on sale and labeling them with messages like Buy One Take One” or Get 50% Off on Selected Items.” These promos can help you boost sales and improve your inventory by letting go of some of your stocks. You need a POS system that secures every retail transaction, maintaining a record of your customer's contact details, dynamic evaluation of employee performance, and generate sales reports anytime.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it's often more expensive and the hardware is probably going to be unusable if you switch POS software. If you plan to stick with the payment-processing service you are currently using, you should look at POS systems that will work with that system (known as integrated processing” because the outside company's payments are incorporated into a POS). With a flat and predictable monthly service fee, it's beneficial for merchants who want the lowest TCO (total cost of ownership) of any other full-featured touchscreen point-of-sale systems in the hospitality industry.</p>

The POS hardware costs include tablets, monitors, card readers, receipt printers, barcode scanners, and self- service kiosks. As long as you don't need to run any in-person transactions, a point of sale system that works online—with customers inputting their card info in order to pay for your business's product or services—could be all you need.</p>

With this feature, if your business receives a reminder to refill a stock of inventory, you'll simply have to press a few buttons within your POS to do so. Keep in mind that first you'll have to onboard your vendors into your POS system.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity.
