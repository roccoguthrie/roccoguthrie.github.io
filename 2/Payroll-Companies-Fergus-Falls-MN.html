<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
<p>Point of sale system play a great role in Retail or wholesale store industry, where generally the customers are higher in number than the number of checkout counters; this is why, a smooth, fast and efficient sale software is needed. Many small businesses prefer mobile POS hardware since it is typically less expensive and offers more flexibility.
