<p>The bottom line: A good restaurant POS centralizes all the processes of a restaurant, bar or cafe, allowing the manager to improve on what's working and fix what's not. As retailers adopt new POS strategies, they will generate a wealth of data that will yield new insights into customer behaviour, inventory, pricing, sales trends and more. Top-rated restaurant POS systems also offer preset tipping options, built-in distribution, and server payout calculators.</p>
<p>For example, many retailers use POS systems to manage membership programs that award points to frequent buyers and issue discounts on future purchases. POS systems record each time you check out a customer and automatically deduct the purchased item from your inventory list, which is maintained on the systems' hard drive. With the POS software, you don't need terminals, cash registers, barcode scanners, or receipt and label printers.</p>

As mentioned above, locally-installed systems can only be accessed at the physical location of the servers whereas, with a cloud-based system, you could theoretically keep an eye on your sales on a beach in Hawaii if you felt the urge.</p>
