<p>From traditional to mobile, HP is reinventing the customer experience with technology solutions that empower employees and engage customers. Point-of-sale software has allowed businesses to create customer profiles that give them the ability to track the most popular products and determine what products they should market based on their customers' shopping preferences. A credit card is easily read by the machine and the sale immediately sent to be approved. The biggest change in point-of-sale over the past few years are the affordable options available for small, or even micro, businesses available.</p>
<p>Other businesses who launched pre-2000s have since adapted their software to evolving technology. Say hello to the new point of sale (POS), a dynamic, multifaceted touchpoint that meets your customers where and when they're ready with convenience and personalization. Oracle MICROS for Restaurants is the POS solution from the Oracle Corporation, the parent company of NetSuite. Beyond processing transactions, it has reporting and inventory management features and provides access to a variety of integrations that can help you run your business, save time and boost sales.</p>
<p>Whether they are standing at the bar or chilling on the terrasse, your customers want the full experience. Managing the various specials and happy hour promotions, as well as multiple menus in your business, should be easy and convenient. Revel Systems is a robust point of sale (POS) and business management platform designed to maximize security, stability, ease-of-use, and service delivery.

The server stores all the data which relates to the Point of Sale system, allowing the information to be locked into one secure location. For an all-in-one system for taking payments wherever your customers are, pair the Square POS and mPOS systems together to give your business an extra boost.</p>
<p>Unlike the traditional cash register system where you cannot tell which staff member on shift rang up the sale, if you upgrade your POS equipment, you will be able to tell which staff member does what. With older POS systems, managers had a lot more workload. Much like online ordering, customers are interested in on-demand services that reduce wait times. Lightspeed makes it easy to build a customized menu, take and manage guest orders, and facilitate multiple payment methods.</p>
<p>A cloud-based POS system is a point of sale platform that stores information on the cloud. Retailers must adhere to specific standards when selecting POS systems, keeping in mind that the perfect marriage of POS with eCommerce is the key to running a successful retail business in the future. Better software systems allow for a variety of customer data and mailing capabilities which can identify customers by last purchase date, birthday, purchase history, customer type and salesperson.</p>
