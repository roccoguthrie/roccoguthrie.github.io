<p>Point of sale or POS systems are a necessary and invaluable part of most businesses. Restaurants need the ability to securely sell, track and redeem gift card transactions without transaction fees. For example, some restaurants require that items selected by the customers be attended to and can only be placed by the waiter who has the password required to do so. This prevents fake orders - such as may be entered by playful kids - and subsequent dispute on the items ordered. Collecting information even before your guests walk in your restaurant will keep you better prepared for your staff pre-service.</p>
<p>The hardware of a POS system consists of the physical setup like cash register connected to a PC or server, or even a portable device such as a tablet or smartphone connected to a cloud-hosted system. The TouchBistro hardware setup is simple and low cost and the licensing fees are also cheap compared to the gigantic POS systems of yore. Hardware investments are minimal, and the system is cheaper to set up than most traditional bar POS systems because it is compatible with third-party POS equipment.</p>
<p>Many a times the users might prefer to make partial payments- some by using Gift card (GC) and remaining by Cash. Plus, never miss a sale again with offline credit card payments. You get to manage your retail business using a unified interface, which means you can instantly accept payments from multiple channels (credit cards, online payments, etc.) without worrying about third-party fees and restrictions and saving you a lot of time.</p>
