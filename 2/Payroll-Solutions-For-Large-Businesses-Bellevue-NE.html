<p>Point of sale (POS) is a technology for financial transactions at retail establishments, for example, at a supermarket. Pairing 100% compatible hardware options with your software minimizes setup time. Most POS systems are able to be plugged in to the business' high speed internet connection.

<p>Small businesses will appreciate the savings from turning mobile devices into a POS without the need for extra hardware. It appears from such software reviews that enterprise-level cloud-based POS systems are currently lacking in the market.
