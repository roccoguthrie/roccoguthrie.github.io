<p>The bottom line: A good restaurant POS centralizes all the processes of a restaurant, bar or cafe, allowing the manager to improve on what's working and fix what's not. As retailers adopt new POS strategies, they will generate a wealth of data that will yield new insights into customer behaviour, inventory, pricing, sales trends and more.

<p>EMV payments are processed by dipping a credit card into a slot in the card reader and allowing it to read the microchip. One of the biggest advantages of a mobile POS is that it can support your business's growth from one store to many. Before the introduction of technology into the restaurants, bills were traditionally generated by merely calculating the order value manually and giving customers a handwritten receipt.</p>
