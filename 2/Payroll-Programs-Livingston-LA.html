<p>Keeping a count all the inventory and in-hand stock across physical stores is complex. The earliest POS systems were nothing more than written receipts, but retailers now prefer electronic POS solutions These streamline the sales process, as well as allowing the merchant to collect valuable sales data.

<p>Small businesses will appreciate the savings from turning mobile devices into a POS without the need for extra hardware. It appears from such software reviews that enterprise-level cloud-based POS systems are currently lacking in the market. Finding the company that charges the least for credit card transactions is key, but you may also need a system that can accept cash or be willing to take your business cashless.</p>

<p>In addition, your POS system must be able to perform basic functions such as bar code scanning, payroll management, handling of cash and credit card transactions and integrate seamlessly with online shopping cart systems. This is also referred to as a credit card terminal—it's what merchants use to accept credit and debit card payments. With a mobile POS system, on the other hand, they can split the check right at the table and, if there's any confusion as to who ordered what or how the table wants to divide a shared appetizer, the waiter is right there to ask the customers.</p>
<p>In a market full of point-of-sale providers marketing to restaurants, it can be hard to decide which option is best for your business. Revel Systems POS is actually a full-scale restaurant management system. Tiger POS is a point of sale platform that has been built for store owners by store owners, specifically for liquor store owners. What you get for the fee is an application that lets you provide multiple payment options and collect them, conduct sales campaigns, monitor and manage your inventory, build and offer promotional and other reward campaigns, and evaluate the performance of your business with the software's capable reporting and analytics engine.</p>
<p>Successful retail stores rely heavily on their software from online fulfillment systems to buy online pick-up in store (BOPIS), from tracking loyalty and employee hours to marketing via text and email messaging. With the ability to track reservations and know which tables are reserved at the beginning of service, it becomes much easier to seat walk-in customers. It will help you manage your menu items, and even track your employee's time and hours worked.</p>
<p>POS Nation offers robust customer loyalty tools to empower retailers to make the most out of their loyal and returning customers. Ideally, your business's point of sale should be able to provide your customer with receipts in whatever form they prefer.
