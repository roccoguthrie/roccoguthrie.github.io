<p>The days of conventional cash registers are almost over, as the modern point-of-sale (POS) has grown its popularity in the last few years. Transaction Fees - Other charges your restaurant business will possibly incur via POS systems are transaction fees for the payments you process.

<p>Retail 4.0 is the way forward for points of sale systems. By installing a POS software and removing the old manual cash register a shop can save a lot of money and resolve common issues like shrinkage. Combing mobile tablets with an intuitive restaurant POS interface is just one way to accelerate speed of service - and keep guests happy - at quick-service and fast-casual enterprises. POS software has indeed benefited small businesses, from brick-and-mortar stores to online sellers, revolutionizing the way these companies manage their sales transactions.</p>
