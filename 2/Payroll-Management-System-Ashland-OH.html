<p>The time and attendance system is another crucial aspect of managing labor. The Lavu restaurant POS system can proceed with payment processing even in offline mode. But the POS has transformed physical retail, allowing SMBs and large corporations alike to gain new, deep insights into their business. This is why I recommend taking your time and assessing the various people you will rely on to make the software work for your business. Evolving from the bulky, complex cash register system to today's highly-portable, fits-in-your-pocket card readers, accepting payments has never been simpler.</p>

Regardless if you're operating a small shop or a restaurant, you would want automation to be on your side when managing sales transactions. With a good (POS) point of sale system, you'll shape inventory to meet customer needs, and find ways to improve the bottom line.</p>
