This software is popular among small retail businesses because of its clear, unlimited, and no-hidden charges plans. Lavu is a point-of-sale software solution with features such as an intelligent combination of cloud computing, wireless technologies, and a sleek touchscreen interface for restaurant. Consider how you or your staff will be taking payments from your customers. Let's take a moment to look at the different hardware and software specs as they apply to both Full Service and Quick Service Restaurants.</p>
<p>The hardware of a POS system consists of the physical setup like cash register connected to a PC or server, or even a portable device such as a tablet or smartphone connected to a cloud-hosted system. The TouchBistro hardware setup is simple and low cost and the licensing fees are also cheap compared to the gigantic POS systems of yore. Hardware investments are minimal, and the system is cheaper to set up than most traditional bar POS systems because it is compatible with third-party POS equipment.</p>

<p>Again, these exploits by hackers could only be made possible because payment cards were processed through the POS system allowing the malware to either intercept card data during processing or steal and transmit unencrypted card data that is stored in the system database. A POS should have customer relationship management (CRM) to track all customer data. Vend POS checks most of the boxes small businesses are looking for when it comes to a point-of-sale solution.</p>
<p>On-Premise - There are broad ranges of features in on-premise modules, and it is difficult and time-consuming to add new functionalities in this POS solution. A reliable restaurant POS system is the difference between a coffee shop or bar that feels like a disorganized open market, and one where customers enjoy the convenience of ordering remotely from their mobile phones, or perhaps booking tables beforehand and then having their orders delivered right on time.</p>
