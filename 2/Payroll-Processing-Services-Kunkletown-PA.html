<p>POS is now commonly referred to as only the cash register feature within a retail management system. Safe, secure and fast payments: EPOS systems often come equipped with card machines, meaning payments are safe and secure. In restaurants, the ability to track ingredients in real-time and set automatic stock alerts is extremely useful, while, for retail establishments, some systems come with the ability to create your own purchase orders and track inventory across multiple locations.</p>
<p>Manage the tables across your restaurant to monitor which tables are occupied, which are not and how many customers are seated at each table. If you are planning a very small operation, such as bagel or sandwich shop, you may not need a POS system at the opening time, especially if you aren't going to take credit cards (and there are plenty of places that still don't accept plastic). With this feature, if your business receives a reminder to refill a stock of inventory, you'll simply have to press a few buttons within your POS to do so. Keep in mind that first you'll have to onboard your vendors into your POS system.</p>
<p>Square also provides customized pricing and features for retail businesses with sales greater than $250,000. Offering loyalty perks, offering coupons or advertising deals, or sending emails to thank your customers for sales are all examples of this.
