<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>Restaurant Software -FusionResto software lets you manage & run your restaurant business more efficiently through intuitive features. Tableside service helps restaurants reduce or fully eliminate the constant travel by servers between tables and a terminal.

<p>It has numerous SEO and marketing platform integrations so you can easily market your business and attract new customers. CRM databases also let retailers set up timed promotions (when a promotion is only valid for a given timeframe, after which the items on promotion revert back to their original pricing). Bring your in-store and online sales together with Shopify. For small businesses, trends like mobile payments and mobile loyalty programs are especially relevant to product selection.</p>
