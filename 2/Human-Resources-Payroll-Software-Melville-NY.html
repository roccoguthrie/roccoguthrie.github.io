All of these features help you run your business your way, the way it's meant to be run - plus it keeps your customers happy. POS systems increase security as employees are accountable for their orders, sales, and the drinks they pour. In 2015, EMV became the standard of credit card reader for its high security - making payment cards nearly impossible to copy and reduce the huge possibility of accepting counterfeit cards.</p>

<p>With some retail systems, you can buy your own computers and then buy the POS software for your business separately. Most POS providers offer customers terminal and handheld POS systems as well. Know your product inventory in-real time - giving your sales associates more power to up-sell, cross-sell and increase customer value. Point of sale systems used to be stand-alone and front-end systems running on independent databases.</p>

POS software designed specifically for retailers won't necessarily support the needs of a business in the foodservice and restaurant industry.

<p>Business Intelligence tools are used to retrieve this huge amount of data from different systems and give the end user an opportunity for analysis. The primary reason you need a point of sale for a restaurant is to accept cash and credit card payments. Multiple configurations as per the store requirement - I will explain with a simple example, say a retail chain wants to run a promotional offer only in one particular city, in such case, special configurations are required to be done for POS systems running in that city.</p>
<p>It has been proven that businesses that do not accept credit cards for purchases will have at least 60% less sales than similar business that accept credit cards. Example of a restaurant counter with touchscreen POS software by Lightspeed, connected receipt printer, card machine and cash drawer. It provides POS software and hardware, including mobile options. Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is leading the IoT revolution in retail systems, allowing for end-to-end inventory control, smooth tracking of goods through purchase, and eliminating the need for barcode scanners at the register.</p>
