Access the details for every reservation in the calendar to check the date, time, and notes on customers' preferences or their pre-order.</p>
<p>This cloud-based iPad POS system is packed with features, such as inventory management for up to 10,000 items and 2 million SKUs, sales analytics to help you identify buying trends, and customer engagement tools that help you understand your customers.
