<p>Point of sale (POS) can be referred to as a check-out or cash wrap and is usually the location in a store or restaurant where transactions for the exchange goods and services occur. Some point of sale vendors refer to their POS system as "retail management system" which is actually a more appropriate term given that this software is no longer just about processing sales but comes with many other capabilities such as inventory management, membership system, supplier record, bookkeeping, issuing of purchase orders, quotations and stock transfers, hide barcode label creation, sale reporting and in some cases remote outlets networking or linkage, to name some major ones.</p>
<p>The other consideration, when discussing payment processing and POS systems for bars, is the ability to accept all payment types. A mobile POS system means better, faster customer management processes. Restaurants that bustling with clients have installed this new software to be able to track and complete orders in real time, similar to a rail or airport flight schedule. POS system is a computerized network that consists of the main computer linked with several checkout terminals and supported by different hardware features starting from barcode scanners and ending with card payment terminals.</p>
<p>The POS system makes it a good fit for new businesses or businesses with little to no point-of-sale experience. Track your sales, inventory, employees and customers - everything you need to know in one place. Two robust sets of tools are offered - a free Square POS for credit card processing and tracking sales, and the Square for Retail with intelligent and integrated tools purpose-built for more complex retail businesses.</p>

It incorporates barcode, scanning, credit card swipes, inventory scanning and so on. It also helps in handling accounts payable, accounts receivables, customer information, and supplier information etc.</p>
