<p>Choosing a POS, or point of sale, system seems as though it would be quite easy. For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.</p>
<p>Today, smartphones, cloud computing, and RFID technology enable even the smallest businesses to become point-of-sale (POS) wizards. Regardless whether taking orders over the phone or in person, the pizza POS software should guide the staff from greeting the customer through detailed order recording, through any up sells, and to the payment information, and finally the order fulfillment. The buyers guide to POS (Point of Sale) software provides in-depth information to the business people and can help them in choosing the appropriate point of sale system for their industry.</p>
