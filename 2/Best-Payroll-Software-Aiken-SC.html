<p>When it comes to choosing the right Linux POS software for your business it is important that you know what the advantages and disadvantages are to be had from the Linux based ones. But if you've done any online searches for POS systems yourself, you've likely discovered something overwhelming: there's a staggering pile of POS solutions to choose from.

The user interface of Vision Store and Store Mobile is so robust, associates can execute a handful of requests in one easy, uninterrupted step: a purchase here, a return there, a loyalty card, a web order inquiry, a custom order — no problem. As much as customer engagement strategy differs between brands, one thing is consistent across the board: the POS is still the one thing that never fails to bring sales associate and customer together.</p>

This is also referred to as a credit card terminal—it's what merchants use to accept credit and debit card payments. With a mobile POS system, on the other hand, they can split the check right at the table and, if there's any confusion as to who ordered what or how the table wants to divide a shared appetizer, the waiter is right there to ask the customers.</p>
