For retailers, only Cumulus Retail offers a simple solution with the power to scale to a national enterprise network of stores over time.

Some restaurant point of sale systems come standard with an "86 Item Countdown" feature that displays actual counts, deducts from the count when an item is sold and then prevents sales of the item once it is sold out. It's fully customizable and suitable for all types of food establishments, such as full-service and quick-service restaurants, cafes, bakeries, bars, and nightclubs.</p>
