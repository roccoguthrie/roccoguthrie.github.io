Square POS is a point-of-sale software solution with features such as accept credit cards with your iPhone, Android, and iPad along with the flexibility to accept credit card payments anywhere, from Square headquartered in San Francisco, California.</p>
<p>It has solutions for full- and quick-service restaurants, pizzerias, bars, and nightclubs. However, here, it is essential to note that not all restaurant management software serve the same purpose. Sometimes, though, you'll be able to access the software with a one-off flat payment.

After ten years, ShopKeep continues offering small, quick service restaurants an easy user interface with great base features. Retailers have the option of using local, server-based POS software, which stores sales data onsite; however, the best programs are either app- or cloud-based SaaS solutions.</p>

Some basic restaurant POS functionalities like gift cards come at an extra cost. On the software and hardware side each tablet on a customer table has to be networked to the cashier POS station and the kitchen computer so that both are continually updated on orders placed.</p>
<p>If your business is lean and mean, or if you're episodically using the POS, you'll only pay the processing fee of 2.75% per charge for credit cards (the fee is slightly higher for cash payments).
