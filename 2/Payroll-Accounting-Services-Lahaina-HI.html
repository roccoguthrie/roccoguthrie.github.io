<p>It can be challenging to find the right Point of Sale software system for your business. Indeed, these systems are often well suited for small businesses because they are the least expensive of the POS system options, they nonetheless provide many helpful features, including automatic sales and tax calculation ability; calculation of change owed to the customer; sales report generation capability; capacity to sort food stamps and trading stamps (through programming of function keys); and scanning.</p>

Choosing the right point of sale (POS) system is vital for small businesses. Plus, with constant staff turnaround in restaurants, an easy-to-use POS minimizes training time for getting new employees on the floor.

<p>Business Intelligence tools are used to retrieve this huge amount of data from different systems and give the end user an opportunity for analysis.
