<p>Different types of restaurants have different software needs, so when choosing your POS system you must first start by considering the type of food service you are running and then matching it up with the system that will be most productive for you and your business. As you can see, there are many options and features to consider when it comes to retail POS technology. With an integration to your onsite property management system from the POS, you can charge restaurant checks directly to the room for billing.</p>
<p>A traditional retail store monitors and tracks inventory and sales as merchandise is scanned and sold at the cash register. Then this information is sent to the software in the main system, which matches information from the bar code with information in the database listing the inventory. It integrates with POS systems and streamlines taking and analyzing your beverage inventory. Essentially, though, the cost of a POS can be broken out into the expense of hardware and software, and the cost of processing payments.</p>
