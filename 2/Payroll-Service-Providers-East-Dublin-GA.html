<p>Point of sale equipment is an essential tool required for the management of a business' day to day operations. Receive and adjust your inventory items each time you get more items in stock to keep your retail store's inventory levels, and your costs, accurate. They've found this provides an opportunity to focus on customers looking for specific product types and to influence their purchasing decisions earlier on in the sales process. A popular mobile, industry-leading point-of-sale system, Lavu POS has a design specific to restaurants and bars.</p>
<p>POS systems still include both software and hardware components, but they now also offer many new functions as well. As the data are instantly available and input into your retail POS accounting back office software, you can now spot trends as they happen, not after they are long gone. Each day restaurants handle large volumes of cash and credit card transactions, making a POS system necessary.

If you need robust inventory management, reporting, integrations, and lots of customization options - consider Revel. Be sure to ask about customer service when considering a point of sale system for your small business.</p>

<p>For store-owners in any business, it is important to maintain a cash counter for payment purposes. But, make no mistake about it.

Revel , which was founded in 2010, is an iPad point-of-sale system ideal for larger restaurants such as franchises, catering services and restaurants with multiple locations. It means the point of sale transaction or deal that happens between a merchant and a customer at the time of purchasing the product or service.</p>
<p>Sometimes the term POS may be used interchangeably with the term point of service, as customers may use the same technology to make returns. By placing a bar code that represented the SKU on each inventory item, the On Hand quantity of inventory was automatically reduced each time it was scanned at the point-of-sale. It's easy to use features and customer friendly user interface help in a number of advantages that not only give your restaurant business a sophisticated feel but also helps in drawing quick sales through speedy orders and effective management.</p>
