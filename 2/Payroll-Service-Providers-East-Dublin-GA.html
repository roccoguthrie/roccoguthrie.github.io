They've found this provides an opportunity to focus on customers looking for specific product types and to influence their purchasing decisions earlier on in the sales process. A popular mobile, industry-leading point-of-sale system, Lavu POS has a design specific to restaurants and bars.</p>

Be sure to ask about customer service when considering a point of sale system for your small business.</p>

<p>For store-owners in any business, it is important to maintain a cash counter for payment purposes. But, make no mistake about it.

It means the point of sale transaction or deal that happens between a merchant and a customer at the time of purchasing the product or service.</p>
<p>Sometimes the term POS may be used interchangeably with the term point of service, as customers may use the same technology to make returns. By placing a bar code that represented the SKU on each inventory item, the On Hand quantity of inventory was automatically reduced each time it was scanned at the point-of-sale. It's easy to use features and customer friendly user interface help in a number of advantages that not only give your restaurant business a sophisticated feel but also helps in drawing quick sales through speedy orders and effective management.</p>
