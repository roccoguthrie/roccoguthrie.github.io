Be sure to ask about customer service when considering a point of sale system for your small business.</p>

<p>Such systems make quick customer assistance and remote inventory assessment for size, color etc. With an established means of sales control, your business growth can't outpace your ability as an owner to track profit levels against your financial obligations.

But things can always go wrong, especially when you're dealing with back-office functions such as inventory or personnel management.</p>
