Manhattan Point of Sale is the next generation POS system for retail, helping retailers sell, fulfill, and engage anywhere. Bar menus change all the time, and your point of sale system should adapt to it. Whether you offer happy hour specials or a new food item on your menu, you want a system that can sync all the information. It is used to store Money, credit card receipts and other paperwork.
