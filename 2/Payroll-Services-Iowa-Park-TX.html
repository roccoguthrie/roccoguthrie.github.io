If you're selling online or plan to sell online, you should look for a POS system that integrates with your ecommerce store. It means a television set can keep your customers stay at your restaurant. Legacy Systems : Legacy systems — sometimes called traditional POS systems — store data on local servers (in your restaurant) and run on a closed internal network.</p>
<p>Manage the tables across your restaurant to monitor which tables are occupied, which are not and how many customers are seated at each table. If you are planning a very small operation, such as bagel or sandwich shop, you may not need a POS system at the opening time, especially if you aren't going to take credit cards (and there are plenty of places that still don't accept plastic). With this feature, if your business receives a reminder to refill a stock of inventory, you'll simply have to press a few buttons within your POS to do so. Keep in mind that first you'll have to onboard your vendors into your POS system.</p>
