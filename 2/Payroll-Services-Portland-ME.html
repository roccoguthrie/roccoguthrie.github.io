<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>Bartenders should know how to make any drink order a customer can throw at them, even if it's not on the menu. Choosing a system that uses unlocked POS hardware can save you money because, if you decide to switch systems, you may be able to continue using the unlocked equipment. ShopKeep also offers a countertop POS hardware for the register, card reader and receipt printer. It also has a built-in timeclock and sales reports that show your most popular items, busiest hours, and top employees.</p>
