<p>If you are planning on starting a new retail business, or run a retail business and wish to streamline your operation, a crucial component that should be factored into your business plans is a modern day point of sale system and more precisely the benefits a good POS system can offer to the running of your business. A right POS should also keep track of inventory at other branches and provide continuous insights on product sales. As point of sale systems evolved, they became more computerised, storing a product database on a computer server. In addition, you can use them with back-end accounting systems and credit card payment processors Many small to midsize businesses (SMBs) are using these types of cloud-enabled POS services without the need to keep a physical back-end server in multiple locations.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it's often more expensive and the hardware is probably going to be unusable if you switch POS software. If you plan to stick with the payment-processing service you are currently using, you should look at POS systems that will work with that system (known as integrated processing” because the outside company's payments are incorporated into a POS). With a flat and predictable monthly service fee, it's beneficial for merchants who want the lowest TCO (total cost of ownership) of any other full-featured touchscreen point-of-sale systems in the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>Our POS solutions cover both in-store and online sales. ShopKeep promises business owners the lowest possible integrated payment processing rate so you can save on every transaction. For about $4,000, you can get a traditional bar POS system which includes a touchscreen monitor with a built-in PC, a credit card reader, a cash drawer, a receipt printer, and all the cabling required. Table service and fly-by service order entry, cashier financial accountability, and staff communications.</p>
