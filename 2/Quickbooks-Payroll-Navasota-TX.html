Manhattan Point of Sale is the next generation POS system for retail, helping retailers sell, fulfill, and engage anywhere.

The system should facilitate the creation of multiple returns for one sales order at different time intervals. Focus POS enables your business to operate without interruption as you manage tables, communicate orders to the kitchen, process paymentsâ€”and maximize table turnover.</p>
