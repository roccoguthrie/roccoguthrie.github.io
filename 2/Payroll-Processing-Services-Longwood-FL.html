<p>A cashier scanning bar coded merchandise at the check-out point of any retail store is a very familiar and expected occurrence. A POS System is the actual software and hardware you use to manage your business. This is ideal for restaurants where customers order at the counter, freeing up cashiers to help prepare orders faster. QuickBooks allows you to track sales, customers, and inventory quickly and easily through three versions: Basic, Pro and Multi-Store. If you go with a restaurant POS vendor that doesn't offer installation and training, it'll be on you to both install and train your staff.</p>
<p>The other consideration, when discussing payment processing and POS systems for bars, is the ability to accept all payment types. A mobile POS system means better, faster customer management processes. Restaurants that bustling with clients have installed this new software to be able to track and complete orders in real time, similar to a rail or airport flight schedule. POS system is a computerized network that consists of the main computer linked with several checkout terminals and supported by different hardware features starting from barcode scanners and ending with card payment terminals.</p>

<p>A point-of-sale system gives you the ability to accept whatever form of payment your customers prefer. Scanning the bar code at the Point of Sale rather than typing an SKU virtually eliminates errors in pricing and inventory. Global inventory, cross-channel orders and customer profiles are completely visible in real-time so associates are equipped to deliver thoughtful, knowledge-based interactions with a personal touch.</p>
<p>The platform comes equipped with a robust inventory management feature allowing you to customize categories and settings. Reporting: Most POS systems will also come with some form of base reporting If you're a smaller business or one that doesn't plan to rely on analytics much, you may be perfectly happy with a system with just a handful of basic reports. With inventory management, you can change menu details, like name, quantity, and price, in real-time.</p>
<p>Successful retail stores rely heavily on their software from online fulfillment systems to buy online pick-up in store (BOPIS), from tracking loyalty and employee hours to marketing via text and email messaging.

It will help you manage your menu items, and even track your employee's time and hours worked.</p>
<p>Manage staffing needs, menus, marketing campaigns, inventories proactively. If you own a store or shop of any genre, it is virtually impossible in today's competitive business world to survive without having a point of sales system in your cash terminal. To get the best deal on your retail POS system, look for companies that offer month-to-month contracts and open-source POS hardware. Unfortunately, however, the easy-to-use software layout does not provide the advanced tools you'd need to manage a full-service restaurant.</p>
