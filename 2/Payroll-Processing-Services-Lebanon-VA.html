<p>In addition, your POS system must be able to perform basic functions such as bar code scanning, payroll management, handling of cash and credit card transactions and integrate seamlessly with online shopping cart systems. This is also referred to as a credit card terminal—it's what merchants use to accept credit and debit card payments. With a mobile POS system, on the other hand, they can split the check right at the table and, if there's any confusion as to who ordered what or how the table wants to divide a shared appetizer, the waiter is right there to ask the customers.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most valuable way POS systems help you gain better control of your business is through their reporting features. One capability they'll look for is a unified commerce platform that allows them to offer customers a seamless shopping experience that spans in-person, online and mobile channels. Most POS systems allow you to set reminders when certain inventory stocks are running low. We provide with various types of POS application development including restaurants, bar, cafes, retail business and much more.</p>

In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments.</p>
<p>You have access to features like table management, delivery, and cash management.

<p>For store-owners in any business, it is important to maintain a cash counter for payment purposes. But, make no mistake about it. A restaurant POS system doesn't come in the form of a software application only. POS systems can suffer from internet connectivity problems and software issues. Modern POS speeds transaction times, and mobile POS adds a powerful line-busting tool to your arsenal. The intuitive and easy to use point of sale system works on mobile and desktop devices and being cloud-based, allows businesses to access key data whilst on the go.</p>
<p>Also, you'll need all the features that a quality point of sale system provides to aid in managing your operations and growing your store's customer base. Usually, this is an automated process which is scheduled to run at a certain time interval in real stores.

Save time and money with actionable insights and inventory management tools. Point-of-sale (POS) systems have evolved from cash registers to modern hubs that manage sales, customer experience, promotional offers, and operational processes.</p>
