<p>Ordyx is a POS system for restaurants with single or multiple locations. The specialized POS design lets you keep watch and track employees, edit menus and track inventory. It used to be that smaller businesses could not easily process credit card and check payments. In addition, some states (such as California) now require some kind of customer-facing screen be available so customers can view sales information as a sale is rung up.</p>
<p>Furthermore, POS Nation not only helps its clients with customizable software but it also provides them with the right hardware and peripherals for their business. Another advantage associated with Point of Sale software for restaurants is its real-time integration with inventory management.

Not only does it serve as a virtual terminal with stored card capabilities, this well-rounded platform also helps you handle invoicing and recurring billing, scheduling, tip-splitting, inventory, dynamic custom menu building, and much more.
