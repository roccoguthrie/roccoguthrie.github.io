<p>There are EPoS systems which have been developed with the hospitality industry in mind. The cloud-based POS solution helps manage your stuff, serve customers accurately and in time, and monitor performance to depict trends and opportunities. With the diverse needs of different food establishments, no POS software is a fit-all solution. ShopKeep doesn't offer as many advanced features as Toast or Revel, but its raw ingredient tracking software and advanced employee permissions still places this POS system ahead of many of its competitors in these areas.</p>
<p>Other Rezku features include integrated time clock, tableside ordering and payments, cash drawer, kitchen display system, and more. Aside from the POS software and hardware that handle transactions, payment processing, and inventory, other main features include staff management, CRM, reporting and analytics, and integrations. In the hospitality field, this date recorded by POS systems can be used to track what customers need, are lacking, or is profitable and what is not.</p>
<p>Our POS solutions cover both in-store and online sales. ShopKeep promises business owners the lowest possible integrated payment processing rate so you can save on every transaction.

Be sure to ask about customer service when considering a point of sale system for your small business.</p>
