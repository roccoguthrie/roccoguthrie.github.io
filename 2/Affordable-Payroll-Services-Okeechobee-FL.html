<p>Point-of-sale options available to businesses range from simple mobile payment processors to those that can manage large multi-location businesses. As a result, POS systems can now be summed up as "cash registers on steroids." Even before the rise of mobile and cloud tech, POS systems took the basics of the cash register and expanded them to task directly to back-end accounting systems and credit card payment processors The cloud has become a hot trend in this space because it has let many small to midsize businesses (SMBs) make use of advanced POS systems because they can avoid the ongoing expense of deploying and maintaining a back-end server at every location.</p>
<p>It used to be that as a small-business owner, you had just a few ways to accept payments from your customers. Recently purchased by Upserve, the low-cost, user-friendly Upserve caters to bars, clubs, and restaurants.

Six ways Vend's point of sale system will help you grow your retail business.

<p>A POS is a combination of both software and hardware amenities and both can work together to keep track of all the purchases performed at any store. There are other types of monitors which display data input from other POS hardware components. In this article, you'll read about what we found to be the 20 best POS systems for restaurants in the market today based on core features, restaurant management tools, ease of use and more.</p>

The Setup - There are software and hardware components to consider depending on your business type.</p>
<p>Make sure to see how the management and reporting features actually work before you pay any money. Food and drink sectors like restaurants require a different set of features in the POS software than retailers. Keep a track of inventory and enjoy smooth sales operation. As the store plays a larger role, it's time for point of sale (POS) to expand its role, too. These provide retailers with tools ranging from order management and inventory tracking to customer management and payment processing for more seamless transactions.</p>
<p>Menu, inventory and layout management are included in the basic restaurant software package, though add-ons are also available (more on that below).

<p>Business Intelligence tools are used to retrieve this huge amount of data from different systems and give the end user an opportunity for analysis. The primary reason you need a point of sale for a restaurant is to accept cash and credit card payments. Multiple configurations as per the store requirement - I will explain with a simple example, say a retail chain wants to run a promotional offer only in one particular city, in such case, special configurations are required to be done for POS systems running in that city.</p>
<p>You don't need confusion when accommodating custom orders - you need a point of sale software built for bars. There is retail software available that can give you immediate sales reports, create restocking orders, and use integrated credit card processing and high-speed credit card authorizations using an Internet software can also allow you to distribute rechargeable gift cards.
