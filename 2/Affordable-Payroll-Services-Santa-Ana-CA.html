<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>Payment terminals, touch screens, and a variety of other POS hardware and POS software options are used to enable the transaction. From ensuring that there's enough inventory to putting together monthly sales reports, these skills are necessary in ensuring that your store runs smoothly. Although there is software designed specifically for bars, most point of sale systems used by restaurants can also be an excellent solution for bars.</p>
