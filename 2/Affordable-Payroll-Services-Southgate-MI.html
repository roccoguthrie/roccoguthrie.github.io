<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>Check inventory on the fly, assist customers with purchase decisions, and complete transactions — at the counter or out on the sales floor. Square charges a minimal percentage for every tap, dip, or swipe (representing your customer's payment via credit card or mobile device) in your POS device (tablet or smartphone with Square magstripe reader or POS terminal with Square contactless reader). The potential for huge profits, additional sales and repeat customers are the overwhelming reasons to sell gift cards.</p>
<p>Better customer services and better order management is what becomes possible with this system. All in all, I need something that will provide everything to make sales happen quickly, but protect the businesses interests most importantly. AccuCOUNT the inventory management system lets you handle pricing, take delivery orders wirelessly, and adjust inventory count. That leads to quicker inventory turnover, fewer product shortages, and more efficient cash flow management.</p>

<p>So, of course, restaurants handled most of their management stuff manually. Business managers need to look at the lifetime cost of the Point of Sale Systems.

<p>Hardware — Many POS systems come with hardware such as cash drawers, tablets, card readers, and ticket printers. Still, for retail businesses that want a straightforward POS system for online and in-person sales, Shopify packs a potent punch. Retailers with a lot of inventory need a barcode scanner to help them manage, stock, and speed up their checkout process. POS hold all the tracks for customers and their respective orders with an eye on business loyalty programs, which in return results in better shopper experience.</p>
<p>With Cake POS, you have optional choices for hardware bundles and various software or service options. POS systems help different parts of your restaurant and bar communicate with each other.
