<p>This feature has been around since I started in the cash register business some 25+ years ago. Integration of other aspects of the business with the bar POS system : It will entail a lot less hassle if the management of the bar and the patrons can be integrated with the other aspects of maintaining a business. Before diving into why a retail POS is not ideal for a restaurant, let's take a step back a first talk about what a point of sale is and why you should use one in the first place. With Instore, you can take orders and accept payments from anywhere in your store, manage your menu or product catalog, analyze sales data, track inventory, issue gift cards, and customize receipts with coupons and special offers.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it's often more expensive and the hardware is probably going to be unusable if you switch POS software. If you plan to stick with the payment-processing service you are currently using, you should look at POS systems that will work with that system (known as integrated processing” because the outside company's payments are incorporated into a POS). With a flat and predictable monthly service fee, it's beneficial for merchants who want the lowest TCO (total cost of ownership) of any other full-featured touchscreen point-of-sale systems in the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>The POS system is widely deployed by ecommerce stores and many brick-and-mortar stores. Everything is customized to your business based on the features, add-ons, and hardware that you need. Erply is cloud-hybrid POS software for retailers; it suits independent stores as well as large chains. It is easy for software sales people to confuse you along the way. After all, most of us don't think of food as being "inventory," and therefore don't see a logical connection between a UPC bar code number and a yogurt parfait.</p>

<p>It works with all major credit card processors and POS equipment. Its wide array of capabilities that include quoting, invoicing, and ordering, among others, makes the solution a complete retail management system, complemented further by robust reporting features, timesheet, and job functionalities.
