<p>The technology of EPoS or Electronic Point of Sale, has modernized the entire hospitality industry by making its transactions more swift and 100% accurate. Financial Statements: Finally, one of the most important features of a restaurant POS system. Restaurant-specific features include ingredient inventory tracking, table layouts, tableside and online ordering, franchise management, catering and delivery. Most cloud based pos companies provide a monthly subscription often upgrade their software, and you'll get the most up-to-date features with no additional fee.

Vend is mobile, so you can take your point of sale system onto the shop floor, beat the queues and build personal engagement with your customers. POS once referred only to the site—typically, a counter with a cash register where customers handed over cash for goods and services.</p>
<p>Menu pricing control is vitally important to have if your bar also serves food. AB POS is one of the top retail POS solutions that offer robust POS terminals, ecommerce gateways, and software apps. Retail software is great for clothing stores and furniture outlets, but they don't serve the restaurant industry as well.
