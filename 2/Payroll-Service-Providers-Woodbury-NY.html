<p>Ordyx is a POS system for restaurants with single or multiple locations. The specialized POS design lets you keep watch and track employees, edit menus and track inventory. It used to be that smaller businesses could not easily process credit card and check payments. In addition, some states (such as California) now require some kind of customer-facing screen be available so customers can view sales information as a sale is rung up.</p>
<p>For example, many retailers use POS systems to manage membership programs that award points to frequent buyers and issue discounts on future purchases. POS systems record each time you check out a customer and automatically deduct the purchased item from your inventory list, which is maintained on the systems' hard drive. With the POS software, you don't need terminals, cash registers, barcode scanners, or receipt and label printers.</p>
<p>This scenario can make picking the right restaurant management software is a real task. POS systems will solve a multitude of problems in your business. Programming - Your point of sale software has to be programmed to accept your menu, products, and inventory that you'll be selling. Even sales data can be broken down into several categories, such as customer names, bestselling item rankings, or card versus cash payments.</p>
